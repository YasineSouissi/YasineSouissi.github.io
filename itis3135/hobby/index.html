  <h3>Visual Arts</h3>
  <p>To me, Visual Arts is any kind of physical art thats made to be displayed.
     I have to believe this because the variety of art I create is so vastly different which you'll see as you explore my page!
     I have been making art as long as I can remember, whether it be playing with blocks to build the tallest sturcture I coule or drawing a metric ton of frogs.
     It's something that has evolved right along side me as I grew up. 
     Art was a comfort and while I wasnt always drawing, it was good to know that I always had something to come back to.  
      below will be just a taste of what I'm capable of, just some practices I did that I'm particularly proud of for one reason or another.
  </p>

  <p><em>Since I made all this art myself basically all of this was used in order to improve my skill.
    There is a drawing of the statue of david by michealangelo, I did not put a leaf.</em></p>

  <h2>Who</h2>
  <h3>Who is the subject of my art?</h3>
  <p>Usually I choose characters from live action and animated media to recreate in my art as it serves as quick inspiration, as well as a jumping off point.
    The series that has served as a major inspiration recently has been one piece, a series that was brought to us by the talented Echiro Oda.
    I also like this <a href="https://film-grab.com/" target="_blank">website</a> that has a ton of film grabs that I can use to study how the face and body move, as weell as appreciate some interesting cinematogrophy.

  <h2>When</h2>
  <h3>Best Times for Art</h3>
  <p>
    Art is a truly versatile medium for expression in the sense that it can really be done whenever you have the time. 
    This can be to its detrement though especially in my case where I often get to busy to work on a piece for longer than a couple of hours. 
    Of course the reasons for this are largely becasue I have a wide variety of intrests and passions so sometimes art can take a backseat. 
    Regardless though I have still put an insane amount of time into this hobby of mine.

  <h2>Where</h2>
  <h3>Best Locations for Art</h3>
  <p>The thing I love about art is that it can be done basically anywhere, on a plane? Draw. Outside? Whittle. Have time between classes? 3d model.
    Art can be as dynamic as a header or footer, heck even css is an artform. 
    You might notice, however, that it is a very long time sink and can be impeded in many ways as well. 
    Whether it be some heavy boughts of art block or carpel tunnel or even a sprain, art persists. 
    On this page you'll be able to see what kind of art I've done and more importantly the places that I have done them. </p>

  <p><em>The 3d model you see above was a quick little model I created using <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/" target="_blank">tinkercad</a> and while it wasnt the most efficient way to make it, it felt very satisfying, and more than anything fulfilling.</em></p>
  <p>I am eager to learn Blender because of its versatility and convenience, allowing me to create stunning 3D models and animations wherever I am. With Blender's intuitive interface and powerful features, I can unleash my creativity and bring my ideas to life on the go. 
    Whether I'm traveling, waiting for an appointment, or simply relaxing at home, Blender enables me to explore my imagination and develop captivating visual content effortlessly. 
    Its accessibility ensures that I can continue honing my skills and producing high-quality artwork whenever inspiration strikes, making it the perfect tool for my creative journey.</p>

<section id="how" class="section">
  <h2>How</h2>
  <h3>How I Got Started</h3>
  <p>My artistic journey began with simple sketches of frogs, drawn with fascination and curiosity. As I explored the intricacies of their forms and movements, my passion for drawing blossomed. With each stroke of the pencil, I delved deeper into the art of capturing nature's beauty on paper. 
    Over time, my dedication to practice and experimentation paved the way for remarkable growth in my artistic abilities. 
    From the humble beginnings of frog sketches, I gradually honed my skills, studying anatomy, light, and shadow to achieve greater realism in my artwork. 
    Through perseverance and countless hours of practice, I've transcended the realm of amphibian drawings to master the art of depicting human faces with striking accuracy. 
    Today, I take pride in my journey, recognizing that every frog sketch was a stepping stone toward achieving my dream of creating lifelike portraits that resonate with viewers on a profound level.

  <h2>Why</h2>
  <h3>Reasons to Pursue Art</h3>
  <p>Art is inherently fulfilling because it serves as a medium for self-expression and emotional release. 
    Through art, individuals can convey their thoughts, feelings, and experiences in a unique and personal way, connecting with others on a profound level. 
    Whether it's painting, drawing, sculpting, or any other form of artistic expression, the act of creating allows individuals to tap into their creativity and imagination, fostering a sense of purpose and fulfillment. 
    Moreover, art has the power to inspire and evoke emotions, both in the creator and the audience, fostering empathy and understanding. 
    In essence, art enriches our lives, providing a means to explore the depths of our humanity and leaving a lasting impact on both the creator and the world around them.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="images/threed2.jpeg" alt="threed dee printed character">
    <figcaption>Chopper from One Piece 3d print</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p><em>Printing the 3d model that I created helped me understand what the purpose of art was. 
    When you make something its real whether or not it is physical the fact that it exists somewhere and could be made out of PLA plastic gives credence to the fact that we have truly reached an insane peak of creativity. 
    So to demenstrate the way the art affects society heres a Zoro cosplay I did.
