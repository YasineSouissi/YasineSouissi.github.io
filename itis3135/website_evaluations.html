            <h3>The Good Website, Amazon</h3>
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com"><h4>Amazon</h4></a>
            <p>This website is very direct with what it offers, on the nav bar we see a bunch of categorys. Right above that we have the important information about our account like language delivery options and orders. Below there are some advertisements that are put on a gradient and overlapped with products that might intrest us. Largely the items are displayed in white boxes likely to allow it to blend into the transparent background of most prouct photos allowing in to pop.  </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>C</strong>ontrast: Here the contrast is largely saved for the top of the page with the stark dark blue contrasting the off white of the page storing all of the information.</li>
                <li><strong>R</strong>epitition: The repitition best applies to the products in which theyre displayed the same exact way only wavering depending on how we interact with it like when theres a scroll bar at the bottom with related items.</li>
                <li><strong>A</strong>lighnment: Here we notice that everything comes in rows. Visual information is distributed down the site the only thing that lies off center is the search bar which is put that way to make sure its the second thing you see immediatly after the logo.</li>
                <li><strong>P</strong>roximity: This website knows how far to put its products where theres enough space to where they're not touching but not too much so it doesnt feel like empty space.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Bad Website, Seychelles Government Page</h3>
            <a href="https://www.egov.sc/"><h4>Seychelles Government Site</h4></a>
            <p>This website is OLD to say the least. It definetly feels like it was made in the early days of the internet but it wasnt, the last time this site was updated was in 2015 so nearly a decade at this point. Granted this website does have everything you would need if your going on the website in the first place. It has a bunch of boxes that would answer any FAQ's and images embeded with links to their phone or ways to download forms. </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>C</strong>ontrast: Theres very little here, the website is largely shades of white and blue and gray and despite this being sort of boring a lot of the times the gray is used against the white it becomes hard to read.</li>
                <li><strong>R</strong>epitition: On this site for the most part repeated elements share the same styling however there are certain images that arent aligned the same and the transparent image background comes to the sites detriment as it can be difficult to tell which link im clicking on.</li>
                <li><strong>A</strong>lighnment: The first half of the page actually does have decent alignment and styling but the second we get to the second half of the page everything falls apart not only is there no cohesion in how the elements are aligned but they also flip flop between being a stylized version of the text and just having the text as a caption. </li>
                <li><strong>P</strong>roximity: On this site the spaces between elements is almost never consistent on the image at the top its far closer than the drop downs.</li>
